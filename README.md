## Live economic data (FRED)

The **Economics & Macro** modules are wired to **FRED** (Federal Reserve Economic Data).
The connection is real but **optional and resilient**:

- **With a key** — set `FRED_API_KEY` in the environment. Server-side route handlers
  (`/api/econ/series`, `/api/econ/indicators`, `/api/econ/curve`, `/api/econ/calendar`) fetch
  live observations, all dashboard indicators (units-corrected), yield-curve tenors
  (`DGS1MO…DGS30`), and release dates from `api.stlouisfed.org` (cached 10 min). Panels show a
  green **LIVE · FRED** badge.
- **Without a key** — every module renders a **deterministic, seeded simulation** anchored
  to a plausible mid-2026 macro regime. Panels show an amber **SIM** badge. No setup, no
  hydration drift, fully functional offline.

Client hooks render the simulation instantly, then transparently upgrade to live FRED data
when the API reports it — so the UI never blocks or breaks.

**Data as-of dates.** Rates/macro modules show a **`DATA AS OF <date>`** pill in the header
so freshness is never ambiguous. The **Treasury Curve Lab** assembles **real point-in-time
curves** — it pulls each tenor's full daily history (`DGS1MO…DGS30`) from FRED via
`/api/econ/curve-history`, then builds the curve as-of Today and 1M/3M/6M/1Y/2Y ago from the
actual observations (the point-in-time scrubber shows each curve's real `AS OF` date). The
deep reference curves (Pre-Hiking 2021, GFC 2009), inversion history and term carry remain
curated. That history fetch is cached for 6h (FRED serves decades of daily data directly, so
no slow accumulation is needed — it's fetched once and reused). The **Macro Dashboard** shows
the most recent observation date across its live indicators, and **Rate Probabilities** shows
the Fed-funds-futures pricing date the FedWatch odds were derived from. Without a key, the
pills reflect the simulation's anchor dates alongside the amber `SIM` badge.

```bash
# Get a free key: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html
FRED_API_KEY=your_key_here npm run dev
# On Vercel/Netlify: add FRED_API_KEY as a project environment variable.
```

**Daily refresh (Vercel Cron).** FRED data is fetched on-access and cached (curve history 6h,
indicators 10 min), so a busy site is always fresh — but to guarantee the curve/rates refresh
**once a day even with no traffic**, `vercel.json` registers a cron that hits
`/api/cron/refresh` daily at 12:00 UTC. That endpoint re-pulls and re-warms the FRED-backed
econ routes (`curve-history`, `curve`, `indicators`, `calendar`) plus the market-data bridge
routes (`/api/market/*`). If `MARKET_PIPELINE_URL` is configured, cron first POSTs to the
pipeline's `/ingestion/run` endpoint with a recent start date so Yahoo-backed market data
refreshes once per day without repeatedly backfilling full history. Tune that window with
`MARKET_CRON_LOOKBACK_DAYS` (default 14), pin it with `MARKET_CRON_START_DATE`, or disable
the ingestion POST with `MARKET_CRON_INGESTION=0`. Historical Treasury yields are immutable,
so each refresh only advances the recent tail. Set a **`CRON_SECRET`** project env var to
lock the endpoint down — Vercel sends it as a Bearer token and the route rejects any request
without it (returns the warm summary on success).

### Data provenance — what's live vs. simulated

Live wiring is **deliberately partial** — some modules have no free upstream API, and the
analytics/model modules are computed layers. Honest per-module status:

| Module | Card values | Drill-down (24m) | Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Macro Dashboard | 🟢 Live (FRED, units-corrected) | 🟢 Live | `/api/econ/indicators` |
| Treasury Curve Lab | 🟢 Live (today + point-in-time) | 🟢 Live tenors | real curves as-of Today/1M/3M/6M/1Y/2Y from FRED daily history (`/api/econ/curve-history`); **inversions live-detected** for every spread from real daily history + USREC (`/api/econ/inversions`); deep reference curves (2021/2009) & term carry curated |
| Economic Calendar | 🟢 Live (FRED release dates) | — | `/api/econ/calendar`; release sensitivities and factor moves are computed |
| Inflation Explorer | 🟢 Live (index → derived MoM/YoY/accel) | 🟢 Live | CPI/PCE component FRED ids; per-item fallback to sim |
| Global Inflation | 🟢 Live (most countries) | 🟢 Live | OECD-on-FRED CPI; per-country fallback to sim |
| Credit Spreads | 🟢 Live (rating curve + IG/HY) | 🟢 Live | ICE BofA OAS FRED ids are real; haircut, counterparty, and substitution analytics are computed |
| Statistical Analysis | 🟢 Live | — | up to 20y FRED history; customizable, incrementally cached, and packaged into desk studies |
| Macro Regime Playbook | 🟡 Partial live/sim | — | FRED/Yahoo/local factor playbook; deterministic factors until pipeline-backed |
| Sec-Finance Economics | 🟡 Partial live | 🟢 Live | SOFR/EFFR/IORB/RRP + Fed-funds backdrop live; GC/specials/sensitivities, P&L bridge, and scenario library curated |
| Cash Collateral Reinvestment | 🟡 Partial live/sim | — | FRED/Yahoo-ready local model for SOFR/EFFR/Fed-path-driven reinvestment scenarios |
| Liquidity & Funding Stress | 🔴 Sim / local model | — | stress ladder and signal console designed for FRED/Yahoo/local-book inputs |
| Global Policy Rates | 🟡 Partial live | 🟡 Live (most) | FRED OECD/ECB central-bank-rate series where available |
| Rate Probabilities | 🔵 ETL (FedWatch) | — | `macro_data_etl` gold `fed_probabilities`; live CME with network, else deterministic fallback curve |
| Data Ops | 🟡 Ops metadata | — | local provider health/lineage snapshot designed for `market_data_pipeline` manifests and quality tables |
| ML Applications | 🔴 Sim / model | — | model outputs, not a feed |

🟢 fully live with a key · 🔵 fed by the `macro_data_etl` pipeline · 🔴 simulation/model. The live modules batch-fetch raw index/OAS
series via `/api/econ/batch` and derive the displayed metrics (MoM/YoY/acceleration, streaks,
1d/1m changes) client-side, falling back to the simulation per-series when a FRED id is missing
or no key is set. Every drillable card also calls `/api/econ/series` for its 24-month history —
both flagged by the LIVE/SIM badge.
The **FRED units correction** (`resolveFred`) maps each series to the right transform
(CPI → YoY `pc1`, retail → MoM `pch`, payrolls → `chg`, OAS/spreads → bps ×100, Fed B/S → $T).

> FRED does not send CORS headers, so it is only ever called server-side from the route
> handlers — the key is never exposed to the browser.

### Roadmap implementation update

The `roadmap_feature_implementation` branch expanded the terminal from 22 to 26
modules and added the first collateral-adjacent macro workflow layer:

- **#5 — Cash Collateral Reinvestment (`REINV`)**: reinvestment ladder, spread carry,
  WAL/tenor buckets, policy-path sensitivity, and liquidity buffer analytics.
- **#6 — Liquidity & Funding Stress (`LIQ`)**: stress ladder, desk funding heat map,
  survival horizon, liquidity signals, and scenario console.
- **#9 — Macro Regime Playbook (`REGIME`)**: growth/inflation/liquidity/credit/policy
  regime scoring with desk actions for collateral, reinvestment, lending, and funding.
- **#10 — Data Ops (`DATAOPS`)**: provider health, freshness, quality, lineage, SLA,
  and fallback status for FRED/Yahoo/local sources.
- **Economic & Macro enhancements**: `src/data/econEnhancements.ts` now feeds the
  enhanced SFE, STAT, CRDT, CURV/FOMC, and CAL experiences with shared scenario,
  sensitivity, study-pack, and desk-impact data.

These additions are intentionally adapter-ready: they run locally with deterministic
fixtures today, can use free **FRED** and **Yahoo Finance/yfinance** style inputs, and
can later scale to licensed feeds, internal books, optimizer outputs, and the
`market_data_pipeline` quality/lineage tables without changing the terminal UX.

---

## Global macro pipeline (`macro_data_etl`)

The **Rate Probabilities** module is fed by a companion **Python ETL** (in the
`rl_hub` repo under `/macro_data_etl`) that ingests global macro data from free
public sources and lands it through a raw → bronze → silver → gold medallion
architecture:

- **World Bank** — Global Inflation (CPI YoY by country)
- **BIS** — `WS_CBPOL` central-bank policy rates
- **IMF** — DataMapper fallback for gaps
- **CME** — 30-Day Fed Funds futures → **FOMC hike/cut probabilities** via a
  `FedProbabilityEngine` that replicates the CME FedWatch day-weighting
  methodology (with the standard next-month switchover for late-month meetings)

The ETL exports its gold tables to JSON (`macro-etl export`); a snapshot lives in
`src/data/etl/` and is imported at build time, so the terminal renders it with
**zero configuration and no hydration drift**. Panels show a blue **ETL · MACRO**
badge. CME blocks non-browser clients, so when the engine can't reach live
settlements it uses a deterministic fallback futures curve (flagged in the
tooltip) — run `macro-etl run --source all && macro-etl fedwatch` with network
access to refresh with live values. The shapes are identical, so no terminal
code changes when the data goes live.

```bash
# in the rl_hub repo
cd macro_data_etl && pip install -e .
macro-etl run --source all          # World Bank + BIS → gold
macro-etl fedwatch                  # CME futures → FOMC probabilities
macro-etl export fed_probabilities  # JSON for the terminal
```

---

## Market data pipeline (`market_data_pipeline`)

The **Market Snapshot** / **Live Markets** / **Asset Quilt** / **Index Returns**
market surfaces are served by a second Python service (in
this repo under `/market_data_pipeline`): a production market + macro pipeline
that ingests **FRED** (official macro) and **Yahoo/yfinance** (prototype-grade
market, replaceable vendor interface), lands a raw → bronze → silver → gold
medallion warehouse (DuckDB + Parquet, Polars transforms), validates it, and
serves terminal "cards" over **FastAPI**.

The pipeline's gold views are exported to JSON and committed under
`src/data/market/`, imported at build time so the module renders with **zero
config**. At runtime, `/api/market/[view]` resolves the data from the first
configured source — so the terminal can read a **local cached database or file**
instead of (or before) calling the FastAPI service:

| Priority | Env var | Source | Badge |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `MARKET_DB_URL` | local **DuckDB file** (`/path/market.duckdb`) or **Postgres** (`postgres://…`) — reads the `analytics_api_views` table | `LIVE · DB` |
| 2 | `MARKET_DATA_DIR` | directory of **exported view JSON** (`mdp export-views`) read fresh per request | `LIVE · FILE` |
| 3 | `MARKET_PIPELINE_URL` | the running **FastAPI service** | `LIVE · PIPELINE` |
| 4 | *(none)* | committed build-time **snapshot** | `PIPELINE · SNAPSHOT` |

Each source degrades gracefully to the next (a missing file, an unreachable
service, or an absent DB driver just falls through), so the module always
renders — on Vercel included. The DB drivers are loaded lazily at runtime, so:
- **Postgres** (`pg`) ships as an `optionalDependency` — pure JS, no build cost,
  the realistic cloud/Vercel `MARKET_DB_URL` target.
- **DuckDB** (`duckdb`) is a *native* build, deliberately **kept out of the
  default install** so cloud builds stay fast. For the local DuckDB-file path,
  install it yourself once: `npm i duckdb`.

```bash
# in this repo
python -m pip install polars duckdb pyarrow httpx tenacity pydantic pydantic-settings pyyaml fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" apscheduler structlog
PYTHONPATH=$PWD python -m market_data_pipeline.cli run --offline   # synthetic, no keys/network
FRED_API_KEY=… PYTHONPATH=$PWD python -m market_data_pipeline.cli run   # live FRED + Yahoo

# (a) read a local DuckDB cache file — no service needed:
MARKET_DB_URL=$PWD/data/market.duckdb npm run dev      # (npm i duckdb once)

# (b) read a local exported-file cache — no driver needed:
python -m market_data_pipeline.cli export-views --out ./data/export
MARKET_DATA_DIR=$PWD/market_data_pipeline/data/export npm run dev

# (c) stream live from the FastAPI service:
python -m market_data_pipeline.cli serve --port 8000
MARKET_PIPELINE_URL=http://localhost:8000 npm run dev
```

**Vercel/Postgres live-ish setup.** The cloud path is `MARKET_DB_URL=postgres://...`.
The Next app reads Postgres directly, while the Python pipeline publishes the six
compact terminal views into the `analytics_api_views` table after each refresh.

1. Create a managed Postgres database (Vercel Postgres, Neon, Supabase, etc.).
2. Add `MARKET_DB_URL=postgres://...` to Vercel project env vars.
3. Add GitHub repo secrets `MARKET_DB_URL` and optional `FRED_API_KEY`.
4. Use the included `.github/workflows/market-data-refresh.yml` workflow to run
   daily after the US close. It refreshes DuckDB from Yahoo/FRED, then runs
   `publish-views` to upsert Postgres.

Manual publish flow:

```bash
python -m pip install "psycopg[binary]" yfinance
START_DATE=$(python -c "from datetime import date,timedelta; print(date.today()-timedelta(days=14))")
PYTHONPATH=$PWD python -m market_data_pipeline.cli run --start "$START_DATE"
MARKET_DB_URL=postgres://... PYTHONPATH=$PWD python -m market_data_pipeline.cli publish-views
```

The publisher creates `analytics_api_views` if it does not exist. Once populated,
`/api/market/market` should return `"source":"DB"` from Vercel. Return-bearing
views default to **total return** (`adj_close`) and also publish **price return**
variants (`?basis=price`) from raw close. The app exposes that switch on Market
Snapshot, Live Markets, Asset Quilt, and Index Returns.

**Does running locally refresh the cache from Yahoo?** Yes. `mdp run` (without
`--offline`, `MDP_ALLOW_YAHOO=1` by default) pulls **~10y of daily history per
symbol from Yahoo** — using the `yfinance` library if installed
(`pip install -e ".[yahoo]"`), otherwise the public Yahoo chart endpoint — and
**upserts it into the DuckDB**, rebuilds the analytics, and re-materializes the
`analytics_api_views` table the terminal reads. FRED macro refreshes the same
way when `FRED_API_KEY` is set. For a continuous refresh on a cadence run
`mdp schedule` (market-close · macro-daily · controlled intraday). Yahoo is
unofficial/best-effort and may rate-limit; the scheduled market jobs request only a recent
tail (`MDP_MARKET_REFRESH_LOOKBACK_DAYS`, default 14) and use the configured throttle
(`yahoo_rate_limit`, default 1 request/sec). If a pull returns nothing the
pipeline falls back to the deterministic synthetic source for that run (recorded
in `ingestion_manifest.response_status`) so the cache never ends up empty.

See `market_data_pipeline/README.md` for the full architecture, the 13-table
schema (incl. the `analytics_api_views` serving table), the endpoint list, and
`docs/example_payloads.json`.

## Keyboard workflow

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` or `/` | Open the command line — type a mnemonic (`SLAB`, `PB`, `OPT`…) or a ticker (`NVDA`, `GME`) |
| `Alt + 1…0` | Jump straight to a module |
| `↑ ↓` then `↵` | Navigate / open command-line results |
| Column headers | Click to sort any grid |

---

## Tech stack

**This build** is fully client-rendered Next.js over **deterministic, seeded data
generators**, so all 29 modules run with **zero configuration** — no database, no required
keys — and stay reproducible across server/client renders. Optional live integrations include
FRED for economics, the committed/exported `macro_data_etl` FedWatch snapshot, and the
pluggable FRED/Yahoo-backed `market_data_pipeline`, each degrading gracefully to local
snapshots or simulation when no key/service is present.

- **Next.js 14 (App Router) · React 18 · TypeScript (strict) · Tailwind CSS**
- **Zero-dependency SVG chart library** (sparklines, line/area, bars, candlesticks + VWAP,
  treemaps, Sankey, network graphs, revenue waterfalls, correlation matrices, donuts, gauges,
  heat grids, yield curves, scatter/regression plots)
- **AG-Grid-style sortable data grids** built from scratch for density and speed
- **Optional live data:** FRED via server-side route handlers (`FRED_API_KEY`) and
  `market_data_pipeline` via `MARKET_PIPELINE_URL` for FRED/Yahoo-backed market cards

**Production architecture** (what the demo simulates) — see `ARCHITECTURE.md`:
- Backend: **Python · FastAPI**, analytics in **Pandas / Polars / NumPy**
- Optimization: **OR-Tools · Gurobi · Pyomo**
- Streaming: **WebSockets · Kafka**; storage: **PostgreSQL · TimescaleDB**
- Auth: **SSO · Active Directory · RBAC**

---

## Run locally

The terminal is a standard Next.js app — **zero config, no database, no keys**.
All 29 modules (including Rate Probabilities, which renders the committed ETL
FedWatch snapshot, and the roadmap modules backed by deterministic local fixtures)
work fully offline.

```bash
npm install                 # first time only
npm run dev                 # → http://localhost:3000
```

Requirements: **Node 18+**.

Production build:

```bash
npm run build && npm start  # → http://localhost:3000
```

**Optional — live FRED data.** Set `FRED_API_KEY` and the economics modules
switch from amber `SIM` to green `LIVE · FRED`; without it they use the
deterministic simulation:

```bash
FRED_API_KEY=your_key_here npm run dev
# free key: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html
```

### Optional — refresh the macro pipeline

You **do not** need this to run the terminal; the gold JSON is already committed
under `src/data/etl/`. Run the Python ETL only to regenerate the global-macro /
FedWatch data. It is fully decoupled (Node terminal ↔ Python batch job; the only
link is the JSON in `src/data/etl/`).

```bash
cd macro_data_etl
pip install -e .                                          # polars, duckdb, httpx, typer…
macro-etl run --source all                                # World Bank + BIS → gold
macro-etl fedwatch                                        # CME futures → FOMC probabilities
macro-etl export fed_probabilities --out ../src/data/etl  # write JSON the terminal reads
pytest                                                    # 22 tests, no network needed
```

Requirements: **Python 3.11+**. On a networked machine World Bank and BIS return
live data; CME blocks non-browser clients, so FedWatch falls back to a
deterministic futures curve (flagged in the page tooltip). Refresh the browser
after exporting.

## Deploy free

Module pages are statically prerendered and the FRED API routes are lightweight serverless
functions, so any free Next.js host works with **zero configuration** (the `FRED_API_KEY`
env var is optional — without it the econ modules use simulation):

- **Vercel (recommended):** import the repo → pick this branch → Deploy → get a `*.vercel.app`
  URL. Add `FRED_API_KEY` in project settings to enable live economic data.
- **Netlify / Cloudflare Pages:** same — build command `npm run build`
