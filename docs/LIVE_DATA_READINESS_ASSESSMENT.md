# Live Data Readiness Assessment

Audit date: 2026-06-22. Scope: Vite + React terminal, market data pipeline, macro ETL, DataOps, Market Lens Studio, news NLP, and supporting static data.

## Executive verdict

The terminal is **not yet an institutional live-data platform**. It is a strong terminal prototype with partial live upgrade paths. The only consistently live-capable foundations are: FRED-backed economics APIs when `FRED_API_KEY` is present; market pipeline views when `MARKET_DB_URL`, `MARKET_DATA_DIR`, or `MARKET_PIPELINE_URL` are configured; and optional news/NLP services when provider keys or `NEWS_NLP_URL` are configured — and even these are reachable only in local development, because the `/api/*` handlers are served by a Vite dev plugin and are not deployed by a default `vite build` (see "API serving model: dev plugin vs. production deploy"). Most securities-finance, optimization, cash, prime, collateral, liquidity, alerting, sentiment, and copilot workflows are deterministic fixtures generated from seeded local functions.

The primary risk is **false-live perception**: global chrome says `LIVE`, DataOps fixtures report providers as live, and some modules label generated values as `FRED`, `YAHOO`, `LOCAL`, or `LIVE` without verifying an upstream observation at render time.

## Evidence-driven architecture facts

- The app is a Vite + React SPA (`react-router-dom`), not Next.js. It borrows Next-style file conventions — `src/app/**/route.ts` handlers and `[view]` dynamic segments — but these are served at dev time by a custom Vite plugin (`vite-plugins/dev-api.ts`) that mirrors file-system routing; there is no Next runtime.
- Navigation exposes 37 terminal routes/modules across markets, financing, optimization, economics, and intelligence. The route list is driven by `NAV`, not by provider readiness. `NAV` includes live-market labels as product language rather than proof of live connectivity.
- DataOps has two incompatible truths: fixture functions hardcode optimistic provider health and runs, while `/api/dataops/health` probes actual environment wiring.
- Market data has a credible four-step serving chain: DB, exported files, FastAPI, committed snapshots. This is the best live-readiness pattern in the codebase.
- Economics APIs follow an “always 200” pattern and fall back to simulated histories if FRED is unavailable or per-series fetches fail.
- Macro ETL ships committed JSON exports and has CME/IMF fallback logic; CME FedWatch can be deterministic when public CME access fails.
- News and social intelligence are explicitly deterministic unless external keys/services are configured.
- Internal books are not connected. Securities lending, prime finance, collateral, cash, reinvestment, liquidity, sources/uses, and most optimization outputs are seeded generated data.

## API serving model: dev plugin vs. production deploy

The `/api/*` endpoints in this audit are standard Web `Request → Response` handlers. They are served by one shared registry (`src/server/registry.ts`, built from `src/app/api/**/route.ts` via `import.meta.glob`) in both environments, so dev and a deployed build resolve `/api/*` identically.

- **Development:** `npm run dev` mounts the registry through a thin Vite plugin (`vite-plugins/dev-api.ts`) via `ssrLoadModule`, preserving aliases and hot-reload. Routes work end-to-end.
- **Production:** `npm run build` now builds the client (`dist/`) **and** an SSR server bundle (`dist-server/`); `npm start` runs `src/server/index.ts`, a standalone Node server that serves `dist/` and mounts the same registry. Configured providers (`FRED_API_KEY`, `MARKET_DB_URL`, `MARKET_PIPELINE_URL`, …) are therefore reachable in a deployed build — verified locally: `/api/econ/curve` returns `source:"SIM"` and `/api/market/market` returns `source:"SNAPSHOT"` without keys, upgrading to live when configured. **A static-only `dist/` host (e.g. `vite preview`, plain CDN) still has no API layer and will fall back to snapshots/fixtures — deploy via `npm start`, not a static host.**
- **Resolved:** the previous gap (a plain `vite build` emitted only a static SPA, so every `/api/*` request 404'd in production and all API-backed modules silently degraded to fixtures regardless of env vars) is closed by the standalone server above. The Next-only `next: { revalidate }` fetch option in `src/lib/server/fred.ts` (a no-op outside Next) has also been removed; FRED caching now relies solely on the portable module-level TTL map.
- **Still outstanding:** the README/`cron/refresh` Vercel language (`vercel.json` cron, `CRON_SECRET`) remains unwired — for `npm start` deployments the daily warm-up should be driven by an external scheduler hitting `/api/cron/refresh`, or a `vercel.json` added if targeting Vercel.

### Frontend modules and data origins

"Dev live coverage" is the ceiling reachable under `npm run dev` with providers configured. **With `npm start` (the standalone server) deployed coverage now equals dev**, since the same route registry runs in production. The "Default-deploy coverage" column below describes the **static-only `dist/` host failure mode** (e.g. `vite preview` or a plain CDN with no API layer): rows whose data flows through `/api/*` drop to their snapshot/fixture fallback because no handler responds; rows fed by local imports or seeded fixtures are unaffected. "= dev" means the row has no `/api` dependency and behaves identically everywhere. See "API serving model" — deploy via `npm start`, not a static host, to keep the dev figures.

### Backend/API inventory

| API/service | Purpose | Upstreams | Refresh/update behavior | Readiness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/market/[view]` | Serves market snapshots/views | DB, exported files, FastAPI, committed JSON | Request-time lookup; no scheduler in route handler | Best pattern by shape, but only served by the Vite dev plugin — not deployed in a default `vite build` (see "API serving model") |
| `/api/econ/*` | FRED-backed economics series, curve, indicators, stats, calendar | FRED if key, local simulated histories otherwise | Request-time fetch/cache behavior in server FRED library | Useful but fallback transparency must be stricter |
| `/api/dataops/health` | Actual runtime provider probe | env vars, service health URLs | Request-time probes | Good operational truth source |
| `/api/dataops/runs` | Lineage/runs | fixture data + optional manifests | mostly fixture | Not authoritative |
| `/api/news` | News provider chain + NLP | Alpha Vantage/Marketaux/Finnhub/NewsAPI/NLP optional | Request-time | Not production until keys/feed SLAs exist |
| `/api/social` | Social sentiment | none currently; SIM engine | Always 200 SIM in route | Not live |
| `/api/market-lens` | Market Lens backend proxy | `MARKET_LENS_URL` else snapshots | Request-time | Partial |

| `market_data_pipeline` | Ingest FRED/Yahoo, quality, DuckDB, Parquet, API | FRED, Yahoo, Synthetic | scheduler jobs exist for daily/intraday | Solid prototype; live depends on env and running service |
| `macro_data_etl` | Macro ETL/gold exports | World Bank/BIS/IMF/CME/FRED-style catalog | CLI/pipeline, no verified running scheduler | Partial; committed snapshots stale risk |
| `news_nlp` | FinBERT/lexicon NLP service | transformer model, heuristics | service/CLI | Optional; fallback is lexicon/SIM |
| `market_lens_studio` | Analytics API/orchestrator | cached DuckDB/Yahoo/FRED adapters | service-driven | Partial; frontend falls back to snapshots |

### Data layer inventory

| Layer | Files/tables | Source | Freshness status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Committed market JSON | `src/data/market/*.json` | exported market pipeline views | mostly `2026-06-17`/`2026-06-18`; snapshot fallback |
| Committed macro ETL JSON | `src/data/etl/*.json` | macro ETL gold exports | mixed; inflation/policy time series begin in 2024, Fed probs as of `2026-06-18` |
| Static TS data modules | `src/data/*.ts` | seeded generators/static arrays | deterministic, not live |
| Market pipeline storage | DuckDB/parquet/archive modules | runtime pipeline output | credible but not guaranteed present |
| Macro ETL raw/bronze/silver/gold | `.gitkeep` dirs + loader code | runtime ETL output | directories empty in repo |
| News NLP storage | app settings/storage modules | runtime service | no committed live corpus |

## Provider inventory and DataOps audit

## Lineage map by domain

```text
FRED_API_KEY -> src/lib/server/fred.ts -> /api/econ/* -> hooks/useEcon + economics pages -> SourceBadge/FRED or SIM
Yahoo/FRED -> market_data_pipeline ingestion -> DuckDB/parquet/exported JSON/FastAPI -> /api/market/[view] -> market pages
World Bank/BIS/IMF/CME -> macro_data_etl pipeline -> src/data/etl/*.json -> global CPI/policy/FOMC pages
NEWS provider keys -> src/lib/server/newsProviders.ts -> /api/news -> news page -> optional NEWS_NLP scoring
NEWS_NLP_URL -> news_nlp service -> /api/news or sentiment scoring -> news/copy layers
Seeded TS generators -> page imports -> UI tables/cards -> no storage, no upstream, no true as-of
DataOps fixtures -> src/data/dataOps.ts -> /api/dataops/runs/page -> apparent lineage, but not authoritative
```

## Freshness audit

- Market JSON snapshots expose `asof` and currently indicate `2026-06-17` or `2026-06-18`. This is acceptable as a cache label, but not proof that a scheduler is running today. **Now surfaced:** the market modules (MKT, SNAP, QUILT, IRET) pass `asof` to the provenance badge, which classifies it via `classifyFreshness` (`src/lib/provenance.ts`) and shows an amber `Nd` once data is aging and a red `STALE · Nd` once it is stale — independent of the source tier, so a live-but-unrefreshed pipeline or an old committed snapshot no longer reads as current.
- FRED economics pages can expose `DATA AS OF` from actual observations, but the fallback histories also produce dates and can be mistaken for real observations.
- Macro ETL pages expose `as_of` for Fed probabilities, but global time-series JSON does not carry a top-level processing timestamp.
- Seeded internal-book modules generally do not expose a real data observation date. Alerts use fixed generated timestamps around 2026-06-17 and should not be treated as live ops.
- DataOps fixture run timestamps are hardcoded around 2026-06-18; they are not evidence of actual runs.

## Data quality audit

Critical patterns:

1. **Always-200 fallback** keeps the UI resilient but can hide upstream failure unless every component displays source and fallback status prominently.
2. **Provider health fixtures** overstate live readiness and conflict with the real `/api/dataops/health` probe.
3. **Synthetic marked as LIVE** in DataOps can corrupt governance metrics. Synthetic should be `AVAILABLE` or `FALLBACK`, never `LIVE`.
4. **Per-series fallback** in economics can mix FRED and SIM in the same module; aggregate module-level badges are insufficient.
5. **Internal books absent** means finance modules have no reconciliation, no lineage, no permissions model, no controls, no QA rules, and no authoritative as-of.
6. **Unverified vendor SLAs**: Yahoo is useful for prototypes but not a production market-data source for institutional terminal workflows.

The "Live %" column is the dev ceiling. Verified per module by tracing each page's data hooks: in a default `vite build` deploy, every module whose render path calls `/api/*` (MKT, SNAP, QUILT, IRET via `useMarketView`; ECON, CURV, INFL, GCPI, GPOL, CRDT, CAL, STAT, SFE, FUND, SENT via the `useEcon`/`useStats` hooks → `/api/econ/*`; MKC, MGC/MOTN via `useChartSeries` → `/api/chart/series`; LENS, NEWS, AI, DATAOPS via their own fetches) drops to a live % of ≈0 because those handlers are not deployed; readiness/lineage/freshness grades should be read against that snapshot/fixture floor. The chart modules (MKC, MGC/MOTN) degrade hardest — their resolver has no client-side fallback, so charts render empty (ERR) rather than from a snapshot. Modules that import only local `@/data/*` (HOME, FOMC, REGIME, EML, DESK, ALRT, and the F-graded financing book SLAB/SQZ/PB/COLL/CASH/REINV/LIQ/SXU/OPT) make no `/api` calls and are unchanged by deploy. See "API serving model: dev plugin vs. production deploy."

## Live vs simulation master matrix

| Module class | Live | Partial | Simulated | Unknown | Estimated live |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Market pipeline modules | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 60% when configured (dev); 0% in default deploy |
| Economics/FRED modules | 0 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 45-60% when key configured (dev); ≈0% live in default deploy (all `/api/econ/*`-served) |
| Macro ETL modules | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 20-30% from cached exports; GCPI/GPOL also overlay live FRED via `/api/econ/batch` (lost in default deploy, ETL JSON remains); FOMC fully local |
| Financing/internal-book modules | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 0-5% (local fixtures; unaffected by deploy) |
| Intelligence modules | 0 | 4 | 1 | 0 | 0-30% in dev; ≈0% live in default deploy (`/api`-served) |
| DataOps | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 30% in dev; ≈0% live in default deploy (probe `/api` 404s) |

"Estimated live" reflects the dev environment; in a default `vite build` deploy the `/api`-served classes collapse to their fixture/snapshot floor. See "API serving model: dev plugin vs. production deploy."

## Readiness heatmap

| Module group | Data availability | Data quality | Freshness | Lineage | Observability | Production readiness |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Market views | 70 | 65 | 60 | 75 | 60 | 55 |
| FRED economics | 70 | 70 | 70 | 70 | 55 | 60 |
| Macro ETL global/FOMC | 45 | 55 | 35 | 55 | 40 | 35 |
| Market Lens | 45 | 50 | 45 | 50 | 45 | 45 |
| News/NLP/social | 30 | 35 | 30 | 35 | 35 | 30 |
| Securities lending/PB/collateral/cash/liquidity | 10 | 20 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 10 |
| Optimization/alerts/copilot | 15 | 25 | 10 | 20 | 20 | 20 |
| DataOps governance | 35 | 30 | 25 | 25 | 45 | 35 |

These scores assume the dev environment where `/api/*` routes resolve. The "Production readiness" column in particular should be read against the serving gap: until the API handlers are actually deployed (see "API serving model: dev plugin vs. production deploy"), the `/api`-served groups (Market views, FRED economics, Market Lens, News/NLP/social, DataOps) serve only snapshots/fixtures in a default build.

## Provider coverage gap analysis

## False-live detection report

| Severity | Surface | Why it appears live | Reality | Fix |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | Sidebar/status chrome | Displays `LIVE`/feed-live language | Status can be unrelated to module data lineage | Gate global live claim on provider manifests |
| 10 | DataOps provider fixtures | `getProviderHealth()` hardcodes FRED/MACRO_ETL as LIVE and synthetic as LIVE | `/api/dataops/health` may say SIM/CACHED | Remove fixture truth from production page |
| 10 | Internal-book modules | Tables show borrowers, margin, cash, alerts, optimization runs | Seeded `Rng` generators | Add `SIMULATED BOOK` watermark and block production use |
| 9 | Macro regime | Factors labelled FRED/YAHOO/LOCAL | Values are static arrays | Pull factors from source APIs or relabel simulated |
| 9 | EML | Model outputs labelled LIVE in data constants | No model scoring pipeline | Add model registry and input lineage |
| 8 | Market modules | Pipeline source badge can show SNAPSHOT/FILE/DB but users may interpret as live | Committed snapshots are stale caches | Add cache age and refresh manifest |
| 8 | FOMC | Rate probabilities show as-of | CME fallback can be deterministic | Show CME vs fallback per meeting |
| 8 | Copilot | Natural language responses sound authoritative | Context may be generated | Require source disclosures in every answer |
| 7 | Sentiment | Survey/social charts have recent dates | Deterministic weekly anchor | Label each component SIM unless real feed |
| 7 | Alerts | Streaming risk/ops alerts with timestamps | Seeded templates | Disable “streaming” language without event bus |

## Unused/wired-but-unused infrastructure

- `market_data_pipeline` includes storage, scheduler, quality, and FastAPI services; the Vite + React app only consumes it when env vars/service are configured and otherwise uses committed JSON.
- `macro_data_etl` includes connectors and medallion directories, but repo data directories are placeholders and frontend mainly consumes committed JSON exports.
- `market_lens_studio` includes rich analytics APIs/orchestrator; frontend falls back to embedded snapshots when `MARKET_LENS_URL` is absent.
- `news_nlp` can run FinBERT/lexicon services; default terminal behavior is heuristic/SIM without `NEWS_NLP_URL` or feed keys.
- Optional DB drivers are partial: `pg` is optional dependency; DuckDB is dynamically required but not declared in `package.json`, so DuckDB runtime path may silently fall through.
- DataOps lineage/run tables exist as fixture generators; they should become consumers of real pipeline manifests.

Potential value is high for market pipeline, macro ETL, Market Lens, and news NLP because they already define service contracts. Value is low for DataOps fixtures until replaced by real manifests.

## Prioritization ranking

Priority score = Business Value × Data Availability × Implementation Ease. Scores are relative 0-100.

| Rank | Module/provider work | Score | Reason |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 1 | Replace DataOps fixtures with real manifests and health truth | 92 | Foundational governance, medium effort |
| 2 | Harden FRED economics provenance per metric | 86 | High availability, low-medium effort |
| 3 | Operationalize market pipeline deployment/export freshness | 84 | Existing architecture, high product value |
| 4 | Add market cache age/as-of manifest to all market views | 80 | Low effort, high trust gain |
| 5 | Connect official economic calendar | 74 | High UX value, tractable |
| 6 | Wire AAII/NAAIM feeds | 70 | Improves sentiment with modest effort |
| 7 | Run NEWS_NLP service + one real news provider | 68 | Converts NEWS from demo to partial live |
| 8 | Add CME/Fed funds futures robust feed | 65 | Fixes FOMC credibility |
| 9 | Build internal book ingestion contract/schema | 64 | Huge value, higher complexity |
| 10 | Solver artifact store for OPT | 60 | Needed before optimization features |
| 11 | Collateral/margin feed integration | 58 | High complexity, high value |
| 12 | Securities lending inventory/loan feed | 57 | High complexity, high value |
| 13 | Treasury cash ledger integration | 55 | High complexity, high value |
| 14 | Alert event bus and rules provenance | 52 | Medium complexity |
| 15 | Copilot source-aware guardrails | 50 | Prevents misinformation |

## Modules that should not receive new features yet

SLAB, SQZ, PB, COLL, CASH, REINV, LIQ, SXU, OPT, REGIME, EML, NEWS, SENT, AI, DATAOPS, and ALRT should not receive new functional features until source lineage, freshness, and simulation labeling are fixed.

## Modules ready for cautious expansion

MKT, SNAP, QUILT, IRET, ECON, CURV, STAT, and chart studios are ready for limited expansion only if every enhancement preserves source fields, observation dates, cache age, and fallback disclosure.

## Recommended 90-day plan

### Phase 1: Governance truth and visible provenance (Days 1-30)

Phase 1 execution has started in this branch. The operational flow and setup checklist now live in [Data Pipeline Overview](./DATA_PIPELINE_OVERVIEW.md).

- Replace DataOps fixture health/runs/lineage with real manifests from market pipeline, macro ETL, FRED API cache, news NLP, and provider probes.
- Change synthetic provider status from `LIVE` to `FALLBACK_AVAILABLE` everywhere. **Started:** the DataOps fixture provider and runtime health probe now report deterministic synthetic data as fallback-available, not live.
- Add module-level and row-level provenance contract: source, provider, observation date, processing timestamp, cache timestamp, fallback reason, and simulation flag.
- Add UI watermarks for simulated internal-book modules.
- Add tests that fail when a page renders operational terms without a provenance badge.

### Phase 2: Make the existing live paths production-grade (Days 31-60)

- Deploy or document market pipeline as required service; automate `mdp export-views` and publish freshness manifests.
- Harden FRED fetch/cache/error semantics and expose per-series fallback.
- Add official economic calendar provider.
- Replace CME deterministic fallback with licensed/robust futures settlement ingestion or clearly demote FOMC to simulation.
- Run NEWS_NLP and one real news provider in a controlled environment; log feed freshness and model version.

### Phase 3: Start internal-book integration before new features (Days 61-90)

- Define canonical schemas for stock loan inventory, loan book, borrow requests, prime exposures, margin calls, collateral assets, cash sources/uses, and liquidity ladders.
- Implement ingestion stubs that fail closed instead of silently generating data.
- Create reconciliation and quality checks: row counts, totals vs GL/books, stale thresholds, null limits, duplicate keys, and entitlement checks.
- Convert SLAB/PB/COLL/CASH/LIQ/SXU/OPT from seeded generators to adapter interfaces with explicit SIM mode.
- Add alert event bus backed by real quality/provider/business-rule events.

## Final conclusion

The codebase is closest to production readiness in market snapshots and FRED economics because those domains have real source adapters, explicit API boundaries, snapshots, and fallback labels. The codebase is furthest from readiness in securities finance and optimization, where UI sophistication masks the absence of upstream internal books and vendor feeds. Before any new features, the team should make DataOps authoritative, make simulation impossible to confuse with live data, and convert seeded internal-book domains into source-backed ingestion contracts.
