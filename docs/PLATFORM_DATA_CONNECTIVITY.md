# Platform Data Connectivity — Holistic View

Date: 2026-06-21
Status: Living reference
Scope: All 37 modules across 6 groups; what each needs to run on live data.

This document is the single place to see **what the platform is, how data flows through it, and exactly which external sources you still need to connect** to take each module from deterministic simulation to live data.

---

## 1. How data flows (the pattern)

Every module follows the same **provenance-first** contract:

1. **Render deterministic first.** Each module has a seeded simulation engine so it renders instantly, SSR-safe, with zero configuration. Nothing ever blocks on a network call.
2. **Upgrade to live when a backend is configured.** API routes always return HTTP 200 with a `source` field; the client swaps in live data only when it's genuinely live.
3. **Label honestly.** A `ProvenanceBadge` (`FRED` / `LIVE` / `DB` / `ECON` / `SIM` …) shows the true source per series/component — no silently faked live data.

### Live backends that already exist

| Backend | Powers | Wire-up | Default when absent |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FRED** (`api.stlouisfed.org`) | All ECONOMICS modules + SENT's VIX component | `FRED_API_KEY` | deterministic `SIM` |
| **market_data_pipeline** | All MARKETS modules + LENS + MKC | first of `MARKET_DB_URL` → `MARKET_DATA_DIR` → `MARKET_PIPELINE_URL` → committed snapshot | committed `SNAPSHOT` |
| **Anthropic API** | AI Copilot | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | canned responses |

### Relevant environment variables

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `FRED_API_KEY` | FRED live econ/funding/rates data |
| `MARKET_DB_URL` / `MARKET_DATA_DIR` / `MARKET_PIPELINE_URL` | market-data pipeline resolver (DuckDB/Postgres, exported JSON, or the FastAPI service) |
| `MARKET_LENS_URL` / `CHART_DB_URL` | Market Lens engine + chart series store |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | AI Copilot LLM |
| `ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY` / `MARKETAUX_API_KEY` / `FINNHUB_API_KEY` / `NEWSAPI_API_KEY` | NEWS headline provider chain (first configured wins) |
| `REDDIT_USER_AGENT` / `STOCKTWITS_ENABLED` / `STOCKTWITS_ACCESS_TOKEN` | NEWS-3 + SENT social feeds (Reddit / StockTwits) |
| `NEWS_NLP_URL` | `news_nlp` FinBERT service — re-scores headlines (sentiment becomes `… + FinBERT`) |
| `MARKET_CRON_*`, `CRON_SECRET`, `CRON_TARGET_URL` | scheduled market ingestion |

### NLP layering (NEWS / SENT sentiment)

Sentiment resolves best → fallback, each flipping the provenance badge:
**provider-native** (Alpha Vantage / Marketaux) → **FinBERT** (`news_nlp` via `NEWS_NLP_URL`) → **in-house heuristic** (negation-aware finance lexicon, `src/lib/server/sentimentNlp.ts`) → **SIM**. The `news_nlp/` package (FinBERT + spaCy NER + event clustering) is scaffolded and runs on a lexicon fallback without the model stack.

**Key takeaway:** the macro/funding surface (FRED) and the market surface (pipeline) are *already wired* — they need credentials/env, not new code. The gaps are the **behavioral, securities-finance, and internal-book** feeds.

## 2. Connection status at a glance

| Status | Meaning | Count |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ **Live-capable now** | Backend exists; set a key/env and it's live | ECONOMICS (14), MARKETS (7), AI (1) |
| 🟡 **Partial** | Some components live, others need a new feed | FUND, GCPI, GPOL, SENT, REINV, LIQ, DESK |
| 🔴 **Needs a new feed** | No backend yet — requires an external vendor/source | FINANCE book (SLAB/PB), SQZ, NEWS, OPTIMIZATION book, CAL, FOMC |

## 5. Recommended connection roadmap

Ordered by **coverage per unit of effort**:

1. **`FRED_API_KEY`** *(minutes)* → lights up all 14 ECONOMICS-FRED modules **and** SENT's VIX component. Highest ROI.
2. **Market pipeline** *(`MARKET_DB_URL` / `MARKET_PIPELINE_URL` + provider keys)* → all 7 MARKETS modules + LENS + MKC + the market side of HOME/DESK go from SNAPSHOT to live.
3. **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** *(minutes)* → AI Copilot.
4. **AAII + NAAIM weekly CSV ingest** *(low effort, free)* → SENT survey/positioning fully live; most of the SENT index.
5. **News + social + NLP** — the chains are already built; finish them:
   - set a **headline** key (`ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY` → Marketaux/Finnhub/NewsAPI) → NEWS tape/narratives/attention go live;
   - set **social** env (`REDDIT_USER_AGENT`, `STOCKTWITS_ENABLED`) → NEWS-3 **and** SENT social (one integration, two modules);
   - run the **`news_nlp` FinBERT** service and set `NEWS_NLP_URL` → upgrades heuristic sentiment to FinBERT and unlocks NEWS-6 clusters. Start *persisting* social for SENT-6 divergence history.
   - All of the above surface in **DATAOPS** under the `NEWS_NLP` provider.
6. **Options (CBOE)** → SENT put/call component + SQZ options fields.
7. **Securities-finance / short-interest vendor** *(paid)* → SQZ and the live SLAB book.
8. **Internal firm books + Gurobi** *(largest integration)* → FINANCE + OPTIMIZATION + DESK on real positions.
9. **Niche feeds** — CME FedWatch (FOMC), economic calendar (CAL), BIS (FUND xccy/FRA-OIS), fund flows (SENT).

## 6. Notes & caveats

- **The simulation is not a mock to be thrown away** — it's the permanent fallback tier and the contract every live feed slots behind. Connecting a source never requires UI changes; it flips a `source` badge.
- **One social integration covers two modules** (NEWS + SENT) — sequence it once.
- **Securities-finance data is the one domain FRED can't help with** — SQZ/SLAB inherently need a borrow/short-interest vendor.
- **Internal books are an integration, not a subscription** — FINANCE/OPTIMIZATION/DESK depend on connecting the firm's own systems (and a solver license), which is the heaviest lift but the most proprietary value.
- Keep this document updated as each `source` flips from 🔴/🟡 to ✅.
