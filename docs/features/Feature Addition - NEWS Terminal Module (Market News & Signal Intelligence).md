# Build Prompt: NEWS Terminal Module (Market News, Social Intelligence & Signal Engine)

Date: 2026-06-20
Status: **Implemented (frontend, deterministic engine)** — live ingestion pending
Module code: **`NEWS`** — Market News & Signal Intelligence

> **Implementation status (2026-06-21).** The terminal-side module is shipped:
> `src/data/news.ts` (deterministic gold-table engine), `src/app/news/page.tsx`
> (all seven core views — Headline Tape, Narrative Monitor, Social Intelligence,
> Market Impact, Attention Heatmap, Event Intelligence, Signal Engine), and the
> `NEWS` nav entry in the INTELLIGENCE group. Data is seeded/SSR-safe and badged
> `SIM`; the gold-table shapes match this plan so the Python pipeline can serve
> them live (Alpha Vantage / Marketaux / Reddit / SEC EDGAR) without UI changes.
> The NLP/clustering/historical-impact *backends* described below are the next
> phase.

## Objective

Design and implement a production-grade **NEWS Module** for the SFX Terminal (Bloomberg-style Securities Finance Intelligence Platform).

This is NOT a generic news feed.

The goal is to create an institutional-quality **Market Intelligence Engine** that continuously ingests, classifies, scores, summarizes, and generates actionable signals from:

1. Financial News APIs
2. X (Twitter) posts
3. Reddit discussions
4. SEC Filings
5. Earnings Releases
6. Economic Releases
7. Central Bank Communications

The system should ultimately answer:

> "What matters right now?"
>
> "Why does it matter?"
>
> "Who is talking about it?"
>
> "How important is it?"
>
> "What historically happens after events like this?"
>
> "Which positions, sectors, asset classes, and securities are most exposed?"

The module must integrate into the existing:

- Next.js Terminal Frontend
- Python Market Data Pipeline
- DuckDB
- Polars
- FastAPI
- Medallion Architecture
- Existing DataOps Framework

---

# Design Principles

The system should behave more like:

- Bloomberg News Monitor
- Bloomberg TOP
- Bloomberg News Heatmap
- Bloomberg MLGO
- AlphaSense
- Koyfin News Intelligence

and less like:

- Yahoo Finance news page
- RSS feed reader
- Generic news aggregator

The focus is:

- Signal extraction
- Regime awareness
- Market relevance
- Historical context
- Narrative evolution

## Notes for implementation (reuse within this repo)

This prompt is a build brief. When implemented, it should reuse existing terminal
infrastructure rather than rebuild it:

- **EDGAR ingestion / section extraction / NLP / regime** — reuse the pieces mapped in
  `docs/features/Feature Addition - EDGAR Filing Intelligence (Regime, NLP & Exposure Analytics).md`
  and the sibling `unstructured_signal_fusion` repo (SEC client, section rules, embeddings,
  HMM, importance scoring, topic drift).
- **FRED releases / Fed communications** — reuse `/api/econ/*`, `src/data/econSeries.ts`,
  `src/lib/server/fred.ts`, and the econ calendar.
- **Historical Event Engine forward-return math** — reuse the Market Lens engine
  (`src/data/marketLens.ts`) which already computes event-conditional forward returns over
  SPY/QQQ/TLT/HYG/LQD/GLD/VIX with committed-snapshot + FRED series.
- **Provenance / DataOps** — reuse the `LIVE / DB / FILE / FRED / SNAPSHOT / SIM` badge
  convention and the `DATAOPS` module for lineage and quality scores.
- **Frontend primitives** — `PageHeader`, `KpiStrip`, `Panel`, `DataGrid`, `NetworkGraph`
  (for the Market Intelligence Graph), `Treemap`/`HeatGrid` (Attention Heatmap), `Sankey`,
  and the charting engine (`src/lib/charting`, `src/components/charting`).
- **Alerts** — signals stream into the `ALRT` Alert Center.
